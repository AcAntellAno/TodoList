Simple Todo list application written using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. 
Will try to implement google auth/signin and as well as themes for the application so that way the user can customize their todo list application as much as they want. 
I also want to be able to sync this application with desktop and eventually phones. I plan to use React Native for this full stack real-time application...eventually :p
